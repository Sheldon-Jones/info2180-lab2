            The Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) consistently expresses 
            grave concern over the high rate of fatal shootings by security forces in Jamaica. 
            Their official position, as reflected in various reports, is that while police are 
            tasked with fighting crime, the use of lethal force must be reasonable, proportionate, 
            and a last resort. INDECOM's investigations frequently highlight a pattern of 
            questionable police operations, including a disproportionate number of deaths arising 
            from pre-planned raids, and a failure to produce written plans for these operations.

        <p>The commission works to hold officers accountable for abuses, and their data indicates
            that the number of fatal police shootings has seen a significant decline in years when 
            INDECOM has been most active in bringing charges and initiating prosecutions. 
            This suggests that their oversight has a deterrent effect, promoting more disciplined 
            policing practices. INDECOM also advocates for measures like the consistent use of 
            body-worn cameras to improve transparency and accountability, as conflicting accounts 
            from police and citizens are common.

        Public opinion in Jamaica on police fatal shootings is often divided and complex, 
        reflecting a deep societal struggle with high crime rates. On one hand, many citizens,
         particularly those in communities plagued by gang violence, express support for the police's 
         aggressive stance against criminals. They view a firm approach, even one that results in 
         fatalities, as a necessary means of self-defense for officers and a way to restore order 
         and safety. This sentiment is sometimes fueled by public officials who defend police actions 
         by stating that those killed were criminals who "challenged" the force. The people who 
         appreciate the police carrying out their functions to this extent, many times have felt the 
         hands of the criminal. Some directly by beinng robbed at gun point, abused, shot at, or assaulted
         in some way. Some persons felt their hands indirectly or what is known as secondary victim. In this
        case, their close relative or friend was victimised and so they believe justice is served when the police
        lawfully kills criminals. 
        </p>
        

         <p>
        However, many Jamaicans,
        especially human rights advocates and residents of marginalized communities, have a very 
        different perspective. They describe a deep-seated fear of police brutality and extrajudicial 
        killings. These citizens often give accounts that conflict with official police reports, and 
        they point to the disproportionate number of young, poor, black men who are killed by the
        police. They believe that while the fight against crime is critical, it should not come at
        the expense of human rights and due process, and they call for greater accountability, 
        transparency, and a shift toward policing that respects and preserves the lives of all 
        citizens.
